Hi, I am Luping Liu (刘路平). I am a second year Master's student in Computer Science from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), supervised by [Pro. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also collaborates with [Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen) (Sea AI Lab) closely. Prior to that, I just obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University, supervised by [Pro. Feng Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0014136). For now, I focus on the acceleration and application of diffusion models, security and generalization of AI. My ultimate goal is to build general artificial intelligence to free people from repetitive and tedious work. 

<!-- I have published 1 First-Author Paper at Top-tier AI conferences (ICLR). -->
