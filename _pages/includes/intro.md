Hi, I am Luping Liu (刘路平). I am a third-year Master's student in Computer Science from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), supervised by [Pro. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also collaborate with [Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen) (Bytedance AI Lab), [Chongxuan Li](https://zhenxuan00.github.io/) (Renmin University of China) closely. Prior to that, I just obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University, supervised by [Pro. Feng Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0014136). For now, I focus on the acceleration and application of diffusion models, security and generalization of AI. My ultimate goal is to build general artificial intelligence to free people from repetitive and tedious work. 

After graduating from Zhejiang University, I will pursue a doctoral degree at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) with [HKUPS](https://gradsch.hku.hk/prospective_students/fees_scholarships_and_financial_support/hku_presidential_phd_scholar_programme)! If you are interested in my work, please feel free to contact me via email at [luping.liu@zju.edu.cn](mailto:luping.liu@zju.edu.cn).

<!-- I have published 1 First-Author Paper at Top-tier AI conferences (ICLR). -->
