Hi, I am Luping Liu (刘路平). I am a second year Master's student in Computer Science from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), supervised by [Pro. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also collaborates with [Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen) (Sea AI Lab) closely. Prior to that, I just obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Zhejiang University, supervised by [Pro. Feng Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0014136). For now, I focus on the acceleration and application of diffusion models, security and generalization of AI. My ultimate goal is to build general artificial intelligence. I have published 1 First-Author Paper at Top-tier AI conferences (ICLR).

<!-- My research aims at developing data-driven methods to study our interconnected world and investigates scientific and industrial problems. His research focuses on **text-to-speech synthesis, singing voice synthesis, speech-to-speech translation, and self-supervised learning**. He has published **5 First-Author Papers** at Top-tier **(CCF-A)** AI conferences (NeurIPS, ACM Multimedia, IJCAI).  -->
