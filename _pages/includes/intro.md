Hi, I'm Luping Liu (刘路平), a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), under the supervision of Prof. [Dong Xu](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/dongxu). I also collaborate closely with [Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen) (Bytedance AI Lab), [Chongxuan Li](https://zhenxuan00.github.io/) (Renmin University of China). Previously, I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). Additionally, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Feng Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0014136). Currently, my research focuses on the acceleration and application of diffusion models. My ultimate goal is to build general artificial intelligence to free people from repetitive and tedious work. 

If you are interested in my work, please feel free to contact me via email at [luping.liu@zju.edu.cn](mailto:luping.liu@zju.edu.cn).
