[Pseudo Numerical Methods for Diffusion Models on Manifolds](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PlKWVd2yBkY) \\
**Luping Liu**, Yi Ren, Zhijie Lin, Zhou Zhao

[**Project**](https://github.com/luping-liu/PNDM) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DIHzHQYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C'></span></strong>
  - This work is a simple, effective and general high-order method for the acceleration of the diffusion model.
  - This work is used as the default acceleration sampling method for famous [CompVis/stable-diffusion ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/CompVis/stable-diffusion?style=social)](https://github.com/eCompVis/stable-diffusion). This work is also included by many diffusion model open-source projects, such as [huggingface/diffusers ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/huggingface/diffusers?style=social)](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).
