**Pseudo Numerical Methods for Diffusion Models on Manifolds** \\
**Luping Liu**, Yi Ren, Zhijie Lin, Zhou Zhao

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09778) \| [Project](https://github.com/luping-liu/PNDM) <span class='show_paper_citations' data='DIHzHQYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C'></span> <span class='show_repo_stars' data='luping-liu/PNDM'></span> 

- This work is a simple, effective and general high-order method for the acceleration of the diffusion model.
- This work is used as the default acceleration sampling method for famous [CompVis/stable-diffusion ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/CompVis/stable-diffusion?style=social)](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion). This work is also included in other famous diffusion model open-source projects, such as [huggingface/diffusers ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/huggingface/diffusers?style=social)](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) and [MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger?style=social)](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver/DiffSinger). In addition, this work is reported by [PaperWeekly](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/yXpzVHlCKX428s4ya0baWw).

**Diffusion Denoising Process for Perceptron Bias in Out-of-distribution Detection** \\
**Luping Liu**, Yi Ren, Xize Cheng, Zhou Zhao

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11255) \| [Project](https://github.com/luping-liu/DiffOOD) <span class='show_paper_citations' data='DIHzHQYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC'></span> <span class='show_repo_stars' data='luping-liu/DiffOOD'></span> 

- This work provides a new perceptron bias assumption to explain the overconfidence problem and designs two-step methods for OOD detection by combining discriminator models and the diffusion denoising process of invertible diffusion models.
